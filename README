 * The ROCKET is short for the Real-time Oribt determination, ClocK Estimation 
 * Tookit, which is based on GPSTK. 
 *
 * In order to compute satelite orbits, clock and upds in real-time, the 
 * structure of the GPSTK is re-designed and pulled out as a independent
 * software.
 * 
 * Further plan of the ROCKET software includes:
 *
 * (1) one kalman filter for orbit, clock and upd estimation
 * (2) real-time processing 
 * (3) four-constellation GNSS satellite orbit determination.
