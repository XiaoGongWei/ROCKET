                     ROCKET

The ROCKET is a Real-time Oribt determination, ClocK Estimation Tookit. 

In order to solve satellite orbits, clocks and other satellite-related products,
such as DCBs and UPDs. A new software should be designed according to the most
recent GNSS model and algorithms.

This software absorbs the merits of several softwares, such as
GPSTK, GAMIT, etc.

Further plan of the ROCKET software includes:

(1) single kalman filter for orbit, clock and upd estimation
(2) real-time processing 
(3) four-constellation GNSS satellite orbit determination.
(4) post-processing compatible.
