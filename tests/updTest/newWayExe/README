# Before you execute the script "upd.sh", please make sure that the current
# directory contains following files:

# You will notice that "upd.sh" employs other scripts as below:
# 1. get_rnx.sh 
#
#    Execution of this script will externally produce "$project.rnxlist"
#
# 2. get_eph.sh
#	  
#	  Execution of this script will externally produce files related to type.list 
#	  , for example: "$project.ephlist", "$project.clklist", "$project.erplist",
#	  , "$project.atxlist", "$project.ssclist"
